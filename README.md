This interactive map project, developed during my internship, showcases a comprehensive and user-friendly web application designed to provide a visually engaging way to explore various locations. The project features a detailed home page that integrates information about the application, a search function, and a streamlined navigation system. The core of the project is an interactive map built using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet, allowing users to explore points of interest with customizable markers, search for specific locations, and access detailed information about each spot through pop-ups. The map is enhanced with responsive design, custom styling, and optional geolocation features, ensuring accessibility across different devices. By combining all these elements, the project demonstrates the ability to create a fully functional, aesthetically pleasing, and efficient map-based application, fulfilling the key requirements of the internship.
